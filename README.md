# Handwriting Recognition: HMM vs CNN Comparison

This project compares two popular machine learning models for handwriting recognition: **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The goal is to evaluate the performance of these models using a dataset of handwritten English characters, assessing their accuracy and suitability for optical character recognition (OCR) tasks.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset**: The dataset consists of images of handwritten English characters.
- **Models**:
  - **HMM (Hidden Markov Model)**: A statistical model used for sequential data, applied here for recognizing sequences of handwritten characters.
  - **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning model designed for image classification, used here for character recognition from image pixels.

## Objectives

- Compare the accuracy of the **HMM** and **CNN** models for handwriting recognition.
- Preprocess the images and extract relevant features (e.g., using HOG for HMM).
- Evaluate both models on a test dataset and compare their performance.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing of images for both models.
- Evaluation of the models using accuracy metrics.
- Comparison of results between HMM and CNN models.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**: 
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `TensorFlow`
  - `Keras`
  - `scikit-image`
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`
- **Model Types**:
  - Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

## Results

- The **HMM model** achieved an accuracy of **50%**.
- The **CNN model** achieved an accuracy of **0%**.
